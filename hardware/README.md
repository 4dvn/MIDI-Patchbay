* [MIDI-Patchbay-Shield](MIDI-Patchbay-Shield) is the main shield you
need to build.

* [MIDI-Patchbay-Display](MIDI-Patchbay-Display) is an optional extra
for mounting an LCD display and rotary encoders.  This is used in
conjunction with the [MIDI-Patchbay-Shield](MIDI-Patchbay-Shield).

* [MIDI-Patchbay-Simple](MIDI-Patchbay-Simple) is the predecessor to
[MIDI-Patchbay-Shield](MIDI-Patchbay-Shield).  It's an older and slightly
simpler version (e.g. no support for displays or rotary encoders), so
good if you just want a basic MIDI merger/splitter unit, or perhaps
something to adapt for your own project.
